Really! </p> <p> From first-time to fiftieth-time speakers, and people with 3 months to 30 years of experience coding &mdash; we want all of you to come speak. And weâ€™re especially excited to host speakers who come from populations that are underrepresented in tech, so double encouragement for you! (That's a lot of encouragement. It's real!) </p> <p> Talks can be shorter (5-7 minutes) or longer (20 minutes), and should be geared toward a group of mixed-experience programmers. If you're thinking about doing a live demo, please include that in your proposal &mdash; we generally discourage them, but if it's going to be well-prepared, there is some wiggle room. We highly recommend you practice your talk with a timer before giving it at Fog City Ruby; the organizers will help keep things running on time and will give you a friendly signal when your time is up. </p> <hr> <h4>Our Call for Proposals</h4> <p> We review submissions on an ongoing basis, and usually have talks scheduled a month or two out, so <a href="/cfp/">submit yours today</a>! </p> <p> Not sure what to talk about? We like talks that are strictly about computers and talks that are about what it's like to be a human building computer programs. We also have a <a href="https://github.com/fogcityruby/organizing/wiki/Topic-Wish-List" target=_blank>topic wishlist</a> that could provide you inspiration! </p> <p> If you're not quite ready to submit and want to talk to an organizer first, you can: <ul class=better-ul> <li> Hit us up <a href="https://twitter.com/fogcityruby" target=_blank>on Twitter</a>. </li> <li> Attend a meetup and ask us in person! </li> <li> Email us at <a href="mailto:hello@fogcityruby.com">hello@fogcityruby.com</a>. </li> </ul> </p> <p> But really, submit!! <a href="/cfp/">http://www.fogcityruby.com/cfp</a> </p> <hr> <h4>Code of Conduct & Speaking</h4> <p> We are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. All speakers are expected to abide by the Fog City Ruby code of conduct, including the content of their presentations. The organizers reserve the right to interrupt a talk if it is violating the code of conduct in a sufficiently severe manner. </p> <p>Here's the complete code of conduct:</p> <p> Fog City Ruby is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
